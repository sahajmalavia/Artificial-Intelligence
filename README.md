# Artificial Intelligence Projects

## Contributors
These projects were collaboratively developed as part of **CSC384: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**, offered at the University of Toronto.

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of various artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms and solutions for classic problem-solving tasks, showcasing concepts such as search algorithms, probabilistic reasoning, and game-playing strategies. The projects include:

1. **Checkers Engine**  
   Implements a checkers game engine with features like game state evaluation, move generation, and AI opponent using techniques such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning.

2. **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
   A probabilistic classifier that uses the Naive Bayes algorithm for classification tasks, designed for supervised learning with discrete feature spaces.

3. **Huarong Dao Puzzle Solver**  
   A solver for the classic Huarong Dao sliding puzzle, implementing state-space search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and A* to find optimal solutions.

4. **Battleship Solitaire Solver**  
   Solves Battleship Solitaire puzzles using constraint satisfaction techniques such as backtracking, forward checking, and AC-3 arc consistency.
