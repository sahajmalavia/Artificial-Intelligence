1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network. 

Looking at the results from my program, it’s clear that the Naive Bayes model isn't treating genders equally. For instance, 99.96% of women in the test dataset ended up with a higher probability of earning >=50K when gender wasn't included in the evidence (E1) compared to when it was included (E2). On the flip side, 0% of men experienced this decrease—in fact, their predicted probabilities likely increased when gender was considered. This means that adding gender into the mix actually lowers womens predicted salaries, which isn't fair. On the flip side, men don't see this drop—in fact, their predicted salaries might even go up when gender is included. Additionally, fewer women are flagged as likely to earn >=50K compared to men. This imbalance shows that the model is favoring one gender over the other, breaking fairness rules like demographic parity (where predictions should be evenly distributed across genders) and equalized odds (where the model should perform equally well for all groups). Essentially, the model is biased against women just based on their gender, which is a big issue when we talk about fairness in machine learning.

2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not?

No. I wouldn’t use this model to recommend starting salaries at a company. The results show a clear bias against women, which means using the model could lead to unfair salary decisions and worsen existing inequalities. Not only could this harm individuals, but it could also expose the company to legal issues. It's crucial to fix these biases first—maybe by removing gender as a factor or using techniques that promote fairness, before thinking about using the model for something as important as setting salaries. Fairness is really important, and I wouldn’t want to rely on a tool that might cause harm. To make sure the model is fair, we need to address these issues before applying it in real-world situations.
